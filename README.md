# Modern Data Storage Technologies

Database systems have transformed dramatically from their inception in the 1960s to the cloud-based platforms of today. This evolution has been driven by growing demands for **scalability**, **performance**, **flexibility**, and the ability to handle ever-**increasing** **volumes** of data. Over the decades, the dominant database models have shifted from early navigational (hierarchical and network) databases, to the relational model, and more recently to NoSQL and cloud-based solutions. Each stage in this journey was influenced by the limitations of the previous generation and the emerging needs of the time.

# Storage historical overview and its evolution

Have you ever wondered how our data storage capabilities transformed from bulky [**magnetic tapes**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_tape) and basic [hard disk drives (**HDDs**)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive) to the lightning-fast [**NVMe**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVM_Express) solutions we rely on today? Since the dawn of computing, storage has been both a fundamental challenge and a catalyst for technological advancement. Early systems were constrained by **expensive hardware** and **limited capacity** - so engineers turned to [Redundant Array of Independent Disks (**RAID**)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID) to increase **reliability**, **availability**, and **performance**. By uniting multiple hard drives into a single logical unit, RAID laid the groundwork for more robust and fault-tolerant storage architectures.

As demand for speed and efficiency soared, [Solid-State Drives (**SSDs**)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive) heralded a major breakthrough with their **superior data access**, **lower latency**, and **improved durability**. The unceasing pursuit of higher performance then inspired the creation of Non-Volatile Memory Express (**NVMe**), a protocol that capitalizes on [**high-speed PCIe connections**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express). This development propelled storage technology into a new era of capacity, throughput, and reliability — one that continues to evolve today.

# Modern storages

When you think about the countless apps, services, and systems in use today, all of them rely on one unifying element: [**storage**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_storage). It’s the bedrock that preserves the “[**state**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science))” of any application or platform, enabling everything from tiny web services to massive enterprise data centers. Building on the foundations of RAID, SSDs, and NVMe, today’s storage ecosystem has evolved into a diverse toolkit designed to meet every conceivable need. Whether you’re working with [**object storage**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_storage) for unstructured data, [**block storage**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(data_storage)) for virtual machines, [**file storage**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system) for shared directories, or one of the many flavors of [**databases**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) - **[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL), or distributed** - you’re tapping into decades of innovations in performance and reliability. Even [**data warehouses**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse) that drive analytics at scale and [**queue systems**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue) that orchestrate event-driven architectures owe their existence to these foundational breakthroughs. This talk will explore how the remarkable ways data is stored, managed, and transformed today.

# Designing the Nearby Friends application

> System design is a structured process for planning and implementing software solutions that meet user needs while accommodating **growth**, **performance**, and **security** considerations. It involves translating **requirements** into a cohesive **architecture**, determining how to break the system into logical **components**, choosing appropriate **data stores** (relational vs. NoSQL), and selecting **communication** protocols (REST, gRPC, etc.). Each decision carries its own trade-offs around **cost**, **scalability**, **complexity**, and **reliability**.

Imagine you are a software engineer at a big tech company. You’ve been presented with an exciting challenge: **implement a Nearby Friends feature** in an existing messaging application. This functionality must aggregate and display real-time location data for users who have opted in and granted permission. The system must be robust enough to handle large volumes of updates, efficient enough to provide near-instant feedback to users, and secure enough to protect sensitive location data.

## Functional requirements

* **User Visibility**: Users should be able to see a list of nearby friends on their mobile apps.
* **Distance & Timestamp**: Each friend in the list displays a distance value and a timestamp indicating when that distance was last updated.
* **Frequent Updates**: The nearby friends list should refresh every few seconds to maintain up-to-date location information.

## Further steps

### Non-functional requirements

* How quickly after a friend moves or changes location should that be reflected in the app? 
* Are we aiming for updates within a second, or is a few seconds delay acceptable?
* Does it need “five nines” 99.999% uptime since it’s user-facing?
* What is the impact if it’s temporarily unavailable? 
* What scale must the system handle?

### Back-of-the-envelope estimation

* Approximately how many users do we expect to use Nearby Friends?
* What percentage might use this feature concurrently?
* How frequently will users send location updates?
* How often will users query the nearby friends list?
* How much data would be generated per day by all updates? 

### High-level system decomposition (components & APIs)

* What are the main components/services in your design?
* How will responsibilities be divided?
* What does the mobile client do vs. the server?
* Does the client do any filtering or distance calculation on its own?
* What APIs or endpoints are needed?
* What would the request/response look like for each? 

### Architectural & technology choices

* What architecture style will you use?
* What protocols and patterns will services and clients use to communicate?
* How will the system deliver frequent updates to clients? 
* Are there existing technologies or SDKs that could help? 
* Where will these services run and how?

### Data storage & modeling

* What kind of storage technology is appropriate for storing users’ location data?
* How will we implement geo-spatial queries in the data store?
* Is caching worthwhile given data changes so rapidly? 
* If the data grows large?

### Asynchronous updates & messaging

* How will the system ingest the continuous stream of location updates from users? 
* How to handle out-of-order updates?
* What are the trade-off of using asynchronous processing?
