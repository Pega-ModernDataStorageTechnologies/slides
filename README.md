# Modern Data Storage Technologies

Database systems have transformed dramatically from their inception in the 1960s to the cloud-based platforms of today. This evolution has been driven by growing demands for **scalability**, **performance**, **flexibility**, and the ability to handle ever-**increasing** **volumes** of data. Over the decades, the dominant database models have shifted from early navigational (hierarchical and network) databases, to the relational model, and more recently to NoSQL and cloud-based solutions. Each stage in this journey was influenced by the limitations of the previous generation and the emerging needs of the time.

Over the course of this 3-hour interactive session, we will learn:
* modern storage technooogies and
* apply them to the designed system.

# Prerequisites

* **A Laptop**
* **Basic Command-Line Skills**: Comfortably navigate directories and execute simple terminal commands.
* **Git Fundamentals**: Familiarity with cloning repositories, committing changes, and pushing to remote branches.
* **GitHub Account**: If you don’t already have one, create a free account on GitHub.
* **Access to draw.io**: A tool for creating and collaborating on diagrams.

# Agenda

## High-level

Below is a high-level breakdown of the 3-hour bootcamp session:
* Storage: A Historical overview and evolution
* Key characteristics of different storage technologies
* Modern storage solutions
* Designing the **Nerby Friends** application
* Wrap-Up

## Schedule

| Time (Approx.) | Activity |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 0:00 - 0:20    | Short intro & ice breaker |
| 0:20 - 0:40    | Historical overview |
| 0:40 - 1:00    | Modern storages |
| 1:00 - 2:40    | Designing the **Nearby Friends** application |
| 2:40 - 3:00    | Summary & Closing Remarks |

# Storage historical overview and its evolution

Short overview of how that all started - from hard drive, through RAID, SSD's, NVME's ...

# Modern storages

Storage is all that allows you to store state - it is all that we build on foundations mentioned above: object storage, block storage, file storage, databases(SQL, noSQL, distributed), data warehouse, queue systems.

# Designing the Nearby Friends application
System design is a structured process for planning and implementing software solutions that meet user needs while accommodating **growth**, **performance**, and **security** considerations. It involves translating **requirements** into a cohesive **architecture**, determining how to break the system into logical **components**, choosing appropriate **data stores** (relational vs. NoSQL), and selecting **communication** protocols (REST, gRPC, etc.). Each decision carries its own trade-offs around **cost**, **scalability**, **complexity**, and **reliability**.

> Imagine you are a software engineer at a big tech company. You’ve been presented with an exciting challenge: **implement a Nearby Friends feature** in an existing messaging application. This functionality must aggregate and display real-time location data for users who have opted in and granted permission. The system must be robust enough to handle large volumes of updates, efficient enough to provide near-instant feedback to users, and secure enough to protect sensitive location data.

## Functional requirements
* **User Visibility**: Users should be able to see a list of nearby friends on their mobile apps.
* **Distance & Timestamp**: Each friend in the list displays a distance value and a timestamp indicating when that distance was last updated.
* **Frequent Updates**: The nearby friends list should refresh every few seconds to maintain up-to-date location information.
